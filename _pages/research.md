## Research Areas

### THE IMPACTS OF HOUSING POLICY AND NEIGHBORHOOD CHANGE ON HOUSING ACCESS

I study how **housing policies and neighborhood change impact housing access of low-income and minority households**, particularly in high-cost metropolitan areas. Gentrification and high housing costs may induce the displacement and eviction of these vulnerable groups while also limiting their neighborhood access. Yet, our understanding is often limited to qualitative accounts and anecdotes due to the difficulties of measuring and analyzing adequate data. We also know little about how housing policy and planning to address these issues, such as rezonings or (different types of) housing supply impacts housing access for these groups.

My research aims to leverage novel data sources and quantitative, geospatial methods to study these dynamics, ultimately informing theory and policy. My recent and ongoing projects have explored:
- How gentrification impacts housing choices of low-income households in the New York and San Francisco metropolitan areas (published in [_Urban Studies_](https://doi.org/10.1177/00420980241244699), co-authored with Karen Chapple)
- How housing construction impacts displacement and exclusion of low- and moderate-income households in Los Angeles and San Francisco (published in [_Journal of American Planning Association_](https://doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2024.2319293), co-authored with Karen Chapple)
- How novel big data sources can help us better study household residential mobility (accepted for publication in _Cityscape_, co-authored with Alex Ramiller, Madeleine Parker, and Karen Chapple)
- Whether there are increasing investor purchases of naturally occurring affordable housing (NOAH) stocks in California and how they might relate to neighborhood change and renter displacement (co-authored with Carolina Reid)
- Whether upzonings in New York City resulted in the displacement of low-income renters (co-authored with Jenna Davis, Karen Chapple)

### HETEROGENEITY OF ASIAN AMERICAN HOUSING OUTCOMES

I am deeply interested in the profound demographic shift towards **greater ethnic diversity in American cities** with a focus on Asian populations. Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial minority group in the United States. They also a very diverse group, encompassing people with heritages from over twenty countries, and have the highest income inequality as a racial group. Although this trend requires an updated understanding of how policy and planning impact patterns of housing access and segregation that extends beyond the white-black binary paradigm, research on Asian American housing outcomes remain extremely scarce.

My dissertation research seeks to **reassess the prevailing narrative that Asian Americans encounter minimal barriers in the housing market**. Specifically, I hypothesize that Asian Americans face both conventional resource-based housing constraints and distinct forms of housing discrimination, which could potentially be underestimated when their vast internal diversity and unique experiences of racism are disregarded in research. Based on this perspective, my research disaggregates the Asian category into different subgroups, focusing on the heterogeneity of their homeownership and neighborhood access while also paying particular attention to how housing policy contributes to these divergent outcomes.

### HOUSING MARKET IMPACTS OF IMMIGRATION AND HOUSING POLICY RESPONSES

Although research has traditionally discussed the politicization of immigration largely through the lens of labor market competition, many countries have recently seen its growing salience in the housing affordability discourses. For example, countries such as Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore have adopted taxation and other policy tools to discourage non-citizen purchases of homes. In some cases such as Canada, public discontents about housing affordability has even led to broader discourses and impacts on restrictive immigration policies as well. I am interested in how immigration and international capital impact local housing markets and the housing policies introduced to address local impacts.

For instance, my research has examined:
- How provincial foreign buyer taxes, in response to international capital inflows into housing markets, impact rental market affordability in British Columbia and Ontario in Canada (submitted to a journal)
