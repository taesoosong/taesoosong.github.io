## 1. How Does Housing Policy Shpae Residential Mobility and Neighborhood Access?

I study the nexus between **local housing policies, neighborhood change, and residential outcomes of low-income and minority households**, particularly in high-cost metropolitan areas. I'm particularly interested in leveraging novel big data sources and quantitative methods to study these dynamics, which traditional survey data may have not fully captured.

My ongoing projects are examining:

- Whether there are increasing investor purchases of naturally occurring affordable housing (NOAH) stocks in California and how they might relate to neighborhood change and renter displacement (co-authored with Carolina Reid)

- Whether upzonings in New York City resulted in the displacement of low-income renters (co-authored with Jenna Davis, Karen Chapple)

## 2. How Is Immigration Changing American Cities and Housing Landscapes?

I am also deeply interested in the profound demographic shift towards **greater ethnic diversity in American and Canadian cities** with a focus on Asian populations. This growing trend requires an updated understanding of how policy and planning impact patterns of housing access and segregation beyond the white-black binary paradigm.

- How provincial foreign buyer taxes, in response to international capital inflows into housing markets, impact rental market affordability in British Columbia and Ontario in Canada (submitted to a journal)
