## Research Areas

### The Impacts of Housing Policy and Neighborhood Change on Residential Outcomes

First, I study the nexus between **local housing policies, neighborhood change, and residential outcomes of low-income and minority households**, particularly in high-cost metropolitan areas. My recent and ongoing projects have explored:
- How gentrification impacts housing choices of low-income households in the New York and San Francisco metropolitan areas (published in [_Urban Studies_](https://doi.org/10.1177/00420980241244699), co-authored with Karen Chapple)
- How housing construction impacts displacement and exclusion of low- and moderate-income households in Los Angeles and San Francisco (published in [_Journal of American Planning Association_](https://doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2024.2319293), co-authored with Karen Chapple)
- How novel big data sources can help us better study household residential mobility (accepted for publication in _Cityscape_, co-authored with Alex Ramiller, Madeleine Parker, and Karen Chapple)
- Whether there are increasing investor purchases of naturally occurring affordable housing (NOAH) stocks in California and how they might relate to neighborhood change and renter displacement (co-authored with Carolina Reid)
- Whether upzonings in New York City resulted in the displacement of low-income renters (co-authored with Jenna Davis, Karen Chapple)

### Housing Policy and Asian American Housing Outcomes

My dissertation research seeks to **reassess the prevailing narrative that Asian Americans encounter minimal barriers in the housing market**. Specifically, I hypothesize that Asian Americans face both conventional resource-based housing constraints and distinct forms of housing discrimination, which could potentially be underestimated when their vast internal diversity and unique experiences of racism are disregarded in research.

### Immigration and Housing Markets

Second, I am also deeply interested in the profound demographic shift towards **greater ethnic diversity in American and Canadian cities** with a focus on Asian populations. This growing trend requires an updated understanding of how policy and planning impact patterns of housing access and segregation beyond the white-black binary paradigm. Recent projects that examine this issue include:
- How provincial foreign buyer taxes, in response to international capital inflows into housing markets, impact rental market affordability in British Columbia and Ontario in Canada (submitted to a journal)
