I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of City and Regional Planning at University of California, Berkeley. **I am on the 2025-2026 job market.**

**I study how housing and land use policies stratify housing access by race and income, and how these dynamics shape broader geographic patterns of segregation and integration.** My research advances the scholarship in two key ways.

First, I focus on the increasingly multiracial and multiethnic urban landscapes of the United States, where conventional Black-White models of housing inequality and segregation often fall short. My dissertation studies homeownership and racial segregation among Asian Americans‚Äîa diverse and rapidly growing population often presumed to have overcome structural barriers to housing access‚Äîto uncover how policy contexts continue to shape unequal outcomes in nuanced ways. My dissertation is supported by the [Russell Sage Foundation's Dissertation Research Grant](https://www.russellsage.org/research/funding/dissertation-research-grants) and UC Berkeley's [Institute for the Study of Societal Issues](https://issi.berkeley.edu/) and [Michael B. Teitz Fellowship](https://ced.berkeley.edu/awards/michael-b-teitz-fellowship).

Second, I integrate novel big data sources and computational methods to track residential mobility at a fine spatial scale, providing a more granular understanding of neighborhood change. These methodological innovations help illuminate whether market forces and interventions‚Äîsuch as gentrification, new housing construction, upzoning, and apartment turnover‚Äîpromote more equitable outcomes or further marginalize vulnerable populations. My work has been published in the _Journal of the American Planning Association_, _Urban Studies_, and _Cityscape_.

I also worked as a Graduate Student Researcher at the [Urban Displacement Project](https://www.urbandisplacement.org/). Prior to my doctoral program, I was a researcher at the [Seoul Institute](https://global.si.re.kr/), studying commercial gentrification and urban industries in downtown Seoul.
