I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of City and Regional Planning at University of California, Berkeley. **I am on the 2025-2026 job market.**

My research examines **how housing and land-use governance structure inequality at the intersections of race, immigration, and class**. Across my projects, I employ **quantitative, geospatial, and qualitative approaches**‚Äîfrom large-scale analysis of census and administrative data to interview-based and community-engaged studies‚Äîto explain the reproduction of housing stratification across scales.

My research advances the scholarship in two key ways.

First, I focus on how the increasingly multiracial and multiethnic urban landscapes of the United States and Canada, among other Global North countries, is complicating the conventional models of racial housing stratification and exclusion. My dissertation studies homeownership and racial segregation among Asian Americans‚Äîa diverse and rapidly growing population often presumed to have overcome structural barriers to housing access‚Äîto uncover how policy contexts continue to shape unequal outcomes in nuanced ways. My dissertation is supported by the [Russell Sage Foundation's Dissertation Research Grant](https://www.russellsage.org/research/funding/dissertation-research-grants) and UC Berkeley's [Institute for the Study of Societal Issues](https://issi.berkeley.edu/) and [Michael B. Teitz Fellowship](https://ced.berkeley.edu/awards/michael-b-teitz-fellowship), among others. One chapter is forthcoming in the _Journal of Urban Affairs_, with additional chapters under review or in preparation.

Second, I integrate novel big data sources (e.g., consumer reference data, assessor records, local zoning and housing database) and computational methods to track residential mobility at a fine spatial scale, providing a more granular understanding of neighborhood change. These methodological innovations help illuminate whether market forces and interventions‚Äîsuch as gentrification, new housing construction, upzoning, and apartment turnover‚Äîpromote more equitable outcomes or further marginalize vulnerable populations. My work has been published in the _Journal of the American Planning Association_, _Urban Studies_, and _Cityscape_.
