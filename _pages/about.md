I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of City and Regional Planning at University of California, Berkeley.

I study how policy and planning interventions shape housing access and broader geographic patterns of segregation and opportunity. My research advances scholarship on this topic in two major ways.

First, I integrate novel big data sources and computational methods to track residential mobility at a fine spatial scale, offering a more detailed view of neighborhood change.

Second, I focus on the increasingly multiracial, multiethnic urban landscapes of the United States, where traditional frameworks of housing inequality and segregation often fall short. My dissertation focuses on Asian Americans‚Äîa diverse and rapidly growing population frequently presumed to have overcome structural barriers to housing access‚Äîto reveal how housing policy contexts continue to shape unequal outcomes. 

My current affiliations include:
- Graduate Student Researcher, [Terner Center for Housing Innovation](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/)
- Graduate Fellow, [UC Berkeley Asian American Studies Research Center](https://issi.berkeley.edu/aarc) and [Institute for the Study of Societal Issues](https://issi.berkeley.edu/)
- Data Science Fellow, [UC Berkeley D-lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/)

I also worked as a Graduate Student Researcher at the [Urban Displacement Project](https://www.urbandisplacement.org/). Prior to my doctoral program, I was a researcher at the [Seoul Institute](https://global.si.re.kr/), studying commercial gentrification and urban industries in downtown Seoul.
