## About
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of City and Regional Planning at University of California, Berkeley.

My research examines how policy and planning interventions promote or mitigate housing stratification by income and race/ethnicity. I analyze how policy and market contexts impact residential mobility, neighborhood access, and homeownership, leveraging big data and computational methods. My dissertation builds on this approach but focuses specifically on Asian Americans, a diverse and rapidly growing population often presumed to have overcome structural barriers to housing access.

My current affiliations include:
- Graduate Student Researcher, [Terner Center for Housing Innovation](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/)
- Graduate Fellow, [UC Berkeley Asian American Studies Research Center](https://issi.berkeley.edu/aarc) and [Institute for the Study of Societal Issues](https://issi.berkeley.edu/)
- Data Science Fellow, [UC Berkeley D-lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/)

I also worked as a Graduate Student Researcher at the [Urban Displacement Project](https://www.urbandisplacement.org/). Prior to my doctoral program, I was a researcher at the [Seoul Institute](https://global.si.re.kr/), studying commercial gentrification and urban industries in downtown Seoul.
