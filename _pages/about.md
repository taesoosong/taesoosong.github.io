## About
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of City and Regional Planning at University of California, Berkeley, studying urban planning and housing policy. My research lies at the intersection of **housing, immigration, inequality, and urban analytics**, organized around two themes. First, I explore how **moving beyond the pan-ethnic ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù category to examine ethnic differences and immigration trajectories** provides a more nuanced understanding of Asian American housing experiences. Second, I investigate **how housing policy shapes residential mobility across varying contexts**, leveraging big data and computational methods. 

My current affiliations include:
- Graduate Student Researcher, [Terner Center for Housing Innovation](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/)
- Graduate Fellow, [UC Berkeley Asian American Studies Research Center](https://issi.berkeley.edu/aarc)
- Data Science Fellow, [UC Berkeley D-lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/)

I have also worked as a Graduate Student Researcher at the [Urban Displacement Project](https://www.urbandisplacement.org/). Prior to my doctoral program, I was a researcher at the [Seoul Institute](https://global.si.re.kr/), studying commercial gentrification and urban industries in downtown Seoul. You can refer to my [**Curriculum Vitae**](https://taesoosong.github.io/academic_cv/song_taesoo_cv.pdf) for more information.
