I am a Ph.D. Candidate in City and Regional Planning at the University of California, Berkeley, and **on the 2025–2026 academic job market.** My research examines **how housing and land use policies structure inequality at the intersections of race, immigration, and class**, integrating quantitative and geospatial analysis with qualitative approaches to explain how institutions reproduce housing stratification at scales.

## Research Overview

My research advances scholarship on how uneven housing supply and the planning systems that shape it structure access to housing and place through two main lines of inquiry.

**First**, I examine how increasingly multiracial city-regions in the United States and Canada, among other Global North countries, complicate traditional models of racial stratification and exclusion in housing. My dissertation analyzes homeownership and segregation among Asian Americans—a diverse and rapidly growing population often presumed to have overcome structural barriers to housing access—to reveal how policy contexts continue to shape unequal outcomes. This research is supported by the [Russell Sage Foundation’s Dissertation Research Grant](https://www.russellsage.org/research/grants/how-does-housing-supply-impact-asian-american-segregation), UC Berkeley’s [Institute for the Study of Societal Issues](https://issi.berkeley.edu/), and the [Michael B. Teitz Fellowship](https://ced.berkeley.edu/awards/michael-b-teitz-fellowship), among others. One chapter is published in the _Journal of Urban Affairs_, with additional chapters under review and in preparation.

**Second**, I integrate new data sources—such as consumer reference data, property assessor records, and local housing and zoning databases—with computational and geospatial methods to track residential mobility and neighborhood change at fine geographic and temporal scales. These analyses clarify how processes like gentrification, new housing construction, and upzoning shape access to housing and opportunity. My work has appeared in the _Journal of the American Planning Association_, _Urban Studies_, and _Cityscape_.
