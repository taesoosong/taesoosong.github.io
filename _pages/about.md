## About
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of City and Regional Planning at University of California, Berkeley, studying urban planning and housing policy. Specifically, my research aims to understand how housing policy and neighborhood change impacts segregation patterns and access to neighborhood opportunities. My dissertation research also focuses on the diverse housing experiences of Asian Americans and how housing policy shapes their outcomes.

My current affiliations include:
- Graduate Student Researcher, [Terner Center for Housing Innovation](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/)
- Graduate Fellow, [UC Berkeley Asian American Studies Research Center](https://issi.berkeley.edu/aarc)
- Data Science Fellow, [UC Berkeley D-lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/)

I have also worked as a Graduate Student Researcher at the [Urban Displacement Project](https://www.urbandisplacement.org/). Prior to my doctoral program, I was a researcher at the [Seoul Institute](https://global.si.re.kr/), studying commercial gentrification and urban industries in downtown Seoul.
